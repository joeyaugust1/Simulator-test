Create an image of a game map with atleast 14 locations on it

BLACKBOXAI

I will create a single HTML file that contains an image-like game map with at least 14 distinct locations marked on it. Each location will be represented with a visually appealing, modern styled circle or icon with the location name next to it. The map will have a visually interesting background representing terrain or thematic style and the locations will be arranged in a spatially balanced way to look like a game map.

Plan:

Create an HTML file
Use an SVG or CSS to draw the map background and locations for crispness and style
Mark at least 14 locations with names
Add modern styling: colors, shadows, fonts
Add subtle interactivity: hover effect for locations
No dependent files; all will be inline within the single HTML file.

I will proceed to create the complete file content now.

Create a crypto currency simulator in HTML

BLACKBOXAI

I will create a single HTML file containing a cryptocurrency simulator. The simulator will allow the user to:

See a list of some cryptocurrencies with their simulated prices
Simulate buying and selling cryptocurrencies with fake wallet balance
Show current holdings, wallet balance, and transaction history
Update prices periodically with random fluctuations to simulate market changes
Provide a clean, modern UI with neat styling and interactive elements.
I will implement all JavaScript and CSS inline for easy execution.

I will proceed to create this single HTML file now.
